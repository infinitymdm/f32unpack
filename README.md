# f32unpack
A tiny Rust program for unpacking and displaying the components of 32-bit floating-point values.

I wrote this program to help me understand and visualize the makeup of floating-point values as described in IEEE 754. It takes in a 32-bit hexadecimal-coded floating-point value and breaks it down into its components.

You can run it yourself by following these steps:
1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/infinitymdm/f32unpack`
3. Navigate to the repo: `cd f32unpack`
4. Execute the program using Rust's built-in tools: `cargo run`
